# If the configuration is local, start a container and mount the config.
# 
# Dependency note: We are using the same base image as the 
# banderson/{{ school_code }}-config image and we are mounting a volume in the 
# same way it does. All this requires us to know quite a bit about that image.
# Maybe it would be better to use a specific base image like 
# banderson/hcpss-config for all config containers.
# 
# Then (I don't know if this part is possible), what is we could define in the
# banderson/hcpss-config image that a volume must be mounted to 
# /var/www/drupal/config/sync? Then the process would be better documented.
